# Ola Bike Request Forecasting

This project focuses on forecasting the demand for Ola bike rides using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data and applying predictive models, we aim to accurately predict the number of bike requests across different time frames, improving resource allocation and customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

Ola bike requests can be highly variable based on factors like time of day, weather, weekday vs. weekend, and location. This project uses historical bike request data to forecast future demand. This forecast can help optimize resource allocation, reduce wait times, and enhance customer experience by predicting high-demand areas and times.

### Objectives

1. Forecast hourly Ola bike requests based on historical data.
2. Improve forecasting accuracy by comparing multiple machine learning models.
3. Generate actionable insights on demand patterns.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/ola-bike-request-forecast.git
   cd ola-bike-request-forecast
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Jupyter Notebook** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

## Data

The dataset used for this project should include the following features:
- **Date and time** of request
- **Location** data
- **Weather** conditions
- **Holiday/weekday** information

For this project, the data file should be saved in the `data/` folder. **Note**: Due to privacy and legal considerations, we do not provide Ola’s data in this repository. You will need to source similar data or synthetic data for experimentation.

## Usage

1. **Run data preprocessing and feature engineering**
   ```bash
   python src/preprocessing.py
   ```

2. **Train the machine learning model**
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```

3. **Generate predictions and evaluate results**
   ```bash
   python src/evaluate.py
   ```

4. **Run Jupyter Notebooks**
   For a detailed, interactive analysis, you can open and run the Jupyter notebooks provided in the `notebooks/` folder:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Model Selection

The project explores different machine learning models:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forests**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**

Each model's performance is compared to select the best one for forecasting Ola bike requests.

## Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics are used to evaluate model performance:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**

## Results

The final model evaluation and performance results will be documented in the `results/` folder. Please refer to this folder for a summary of findings and model accuracy.
